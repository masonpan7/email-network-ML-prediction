# email-network-ML-prediction
This repository contains a machine learning pipeline for predicting management salaries and future connections in an email communication network. Using NetworkX, we extract graph-based features such as degree centrality, clustering coefficients, PageRank, and preferential attachment scores. These features are then used to train predictive models, including Random Forest and Logistic Regression, to analyze employee relationships and salary patterns. The dataset includes node attributes like department and management salary status, allowing for insights into organizational structures. The project applies supervised learning techniques to classify missing salary values and predict potential future email connections.
